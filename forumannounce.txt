[b]Installation[/b]

This version of the scripts should keep working with newer versions of [url=http://www.blender.org]Blender 2.6x[/url]. At the moment of writing this, the following were used during development of the scripts:

[list][*]Be sure first to log in as administrator!
[*]Download and install [url=http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/]Blender 2.60a (64 bit)[/url], use default settings.
[*]Download and install [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyffi/files/pyffi-py3k/2.2.0/]PyFFI 2.2.0[/url], use default settings.
[*]Download and install the [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftools/files/blender_nif_scripts/2.6.x/2.6.00]Blender NIF Scripts 2.6.0[/url], use default settings.[/list]

[b]Notes[/b]

On Windows, use 32-bit versions of Blender and Python. (The 64-bit version of Python lacks xml parsing which is essential for the scripts to work.)
