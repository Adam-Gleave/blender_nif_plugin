<h1>Blender NIF Scripts v2.3.14: Release Notes</h1>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=149157">If you find bugs, please report them on the sourceforge tracker, along with a .blend or .nif that caused the error and a brief description of how to reproduce the error.</a></strong>
Although bugs are squashed as much as possible, it is unlikely that they have all been found.
</p>
<h2>Highlights of this Release</h2>
<p>This release features Fallout 3 import. Some parts of the exporter work as well, but it is not really in a useable state yet. Many bugs have been fixed and some other features have been added, including improved Civ IV bone flags export, support for double sided meshes via NiStencilProperty and Blender's double sided flag, and NiAlphaProperty flags defaulting to 0x12ED (more useful to modders).</p>
<h2>Using the Scripts</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/Blender/Quick_Start">quick-start guide</a> describes how to prepare your textures and how you can use the scripts. The guide also lists the limitations of the scripts, known issues, and workarounds for some issues.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/">Blender 2.45</a> or
higher</strong> (Blender 2.47 or higher is recommended).</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python 2.5</a> or higher</strong> (note that, at the time this is written, Blender does not yet support Python 2.6, so you will need a Python 2.5.x release).</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=199269">PyFFI 1.1.1</a> or higher</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manual Install</h3>
<p>
First, <em>make sure you have Python and PyFFI installed!</em>
Also, <strong>if you installed Blender using the .exe installer, 
you're best off using the Blender NIF Scripts .exe 
installer.</strong> If you installed Blender from a .zip, then you 
should download the .zip, extract its contents, and do one of the following:
<ul>
  <li>For use with Windows, the .zip includes an install.bat file which copies the relevant files to the Blender installation folder. If you have installed Blender via the .exe installer, then it suffices to simply double click install.bat. If you have installed Blender via the .zip, then you should run install.bat from the console. Click Start->Run... and type <code>cmd.exe</code>. A console window pops up. In the console, <code>cd</code> to the location where you extracted the files. Now call install.bat but pass the Blender directory (the directory where your blender.exe resides) as a first argument, between quotes, for instance
  <p><code>install.bat &quot;C:\Documents and Settings\me\My Documents\blender-svn&quot;</code></p></li>
  <li>For use with linux, the .zip includes an install.sh script which copies the relevant files to your ~/.blender folder.</li>
  <li>If for some reason the install script does not work, simply copy the extracted scripts directory to
Blender's scripts directory, for instance to
  <p><code>C:\Documents and Settings\me\My Documents\blender-svn\.blender\scripts</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Restart Blender, and the options to import and export
NIF files will appear in the File-Import and File-Export menu's.</p>
