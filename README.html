  <li>Portions of the original importer were derived (through the
old tested method of cut'n paste) from the obj import script
obj_import.py: OBJ Import v0.9 by Campbell Barton (AKA Ideasman)</li>

  <li>The original importer file reading strategy was 'inspired'
by the NifToPoly
script included with the DAOC mapper, which used to be available at <a href="http://www.randomly.org/projects/mapper/">http://www.randomly.org/projects/mapper/</a>
and was written and is
copyright 2002 of Oliver Jowett. His domain and e-mail address are
however no longer reacheable. No part of the original code is included
here, as we use Niflib now. An updated version of the script is
included with the DAOC Mappergui application, available at <a href="http://nathrach.republicofnewhome.org/mappergui.html">http://nathrach.republicofnewhome.org/mappergui.html</a>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul>

  <li><strong>You
must have&nbsp;Blender 2.41 or higher</strong>; the scripts
won't
run on older
versions
of Blender: <a href="http://www.blender.org">http://www.blender.org</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>The
scripts need a full Python 2.4 installation</strong>: <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>.
The
version of Python installed must be compatible with Blender, or
the scripts just won't run.&nbsp;At the time of writing this the
latest&nbsp;stable version of Blender is Blender 2.41, and it was
compiled with
bindings for Python 2.4.x. You won't need to uninstall Python 2.3 in
order to get the script running, but you need to install Python 2.4 as
well (you can get it from http://www.python.org/). Restart Blender and
everything should work fine. If
you still have problems, check out this LOOOONG thread on the elysiun
board: <a href="http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7723">http://www.elysiun.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7723</a>.
The latest
pages will be the ones you will find more useful, as the thread started
several Blender versions back. </li>

  <li><strong>It is recommended that you use the windows
installer.</strong> If
this does not work for
some reason, you can install the scripts
manually
from
the zip file:
    <ul>

      <li>Remove any old versions of the scripts (such as,
nif-export.py, nif_import_237.py, nif4_export.py, nif4_import_237.py,
nif4_import_240.py, nif4.py, nif4.pyc, ...).</li>

      <li>Copy
the export scripts "nif4_import_240.py" and
"nif_export.py", into the Blender scripts folder.
Under Windows this is by default C:\Program Files\Blender
Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts.
Copy
"niflib.py" into your Python 2.4 Lib folder, delete niflib.pyc from
that same folder if it exists, and copy "_niflib.dll" into your Python
2.4 DLLs folder. Restart Blender, and the options to import and export
NIF files
will appear in the File-Import and File-Export menu's. <em>Make
sure you
have no other niflib.py or _niflib.dll files in other folders.</em></li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>(optional) If you wish to use Morrowind's textures:
    <ul>

      <li>extract the contents of 'Morrowind.bsa' (and, if you
have the expansions, also 'Tribunal.bsa' and 'Bloodmoon.bsa') into
'C:\MORROWIND' </li>

      <li>convert all .dds files in 'C:\MORROWIND\textures' to
.tga files (for instance, using 'DDS Converter 2.1')</li>

    </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Support</h2>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/tutorial/blender/">http://niftools.sourceforge.net/tutorial/blender/</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<ul>

  <li>If you don't use the installer, make sure to remove any
old
versions of the scripts prior
to installing these scripts (the old files from previous versions
are nif4_export.py,
nif4_import_237.py, nif4.py, and nif4.pyc). This is why it is
recommended to use the installer: it detects these files and
automatically deletes them.</li>

  <li>To change the importer and exporter settings, go
to the scripts window in Blender, and select
Scripts-&gt;System-&gt;Scripts Config
Editor-&gt;Import/Export. <em>Note that the scale correction
in the
export config is also used by the importer.</em></li>

</ul>

<h3>Highlights of this Release</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Importer has undergone a complete rewrite and now also uses
Niflib, just like the export script. Niflib has undergone some
upgrading as well, and therefore <strong>the scripts support all
known NIF versions up to 20.0.0.4</strong>.
Hence, both
importer &amp; exporter support all Civilization IV models, except
for animation (but armatures and skinning&nbsp;should work just fine).
For the exporter to write Civ IV files, set "nif version" to for
instance
4.2.2.0 and enable&nbsp;"strip
texpath" in the config editor. Note that the export of animated Civ IV
models is not yet supported. Also, export of higher versions (10.0.1.0,
10.1.0.0,
10.2.0.0, and 20.0.0.4) *should* work as well but this has not been
extensively tested. Import of these higher versions has been tested a
little bit more. In any case, if you find bugs... be sure to report
them to the niftools forum!</li>

  <li>Full skinning support for the importer (finally!).</li>

  <li>Support for hidden meshes in importer &amp; exporter:
set the object's Drawtype to "Wire" instead of &nbsp;"Shaded".</li>

  <li>Various bugs have been fixed in the importer &amp;
exporter &amp; Niflib. </li>

</ul>

<h3>In the background...</h3>

Support for Civ IV animation files (.kf &amp; .kfm) is in progress.<br />

<h2>Exporter Notes</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ul>

  <li>create meshes (and empties, if you like) in blender:
    <ul>

      <li>IMPORTANT: if you wish to animate meshes without
using
armatures and bones, then, when grouping, always make parent without
inverse (in
Object Mode, use CTRL-SHIFT-P) </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>create armatures and bones for animation
    <ul>

      <li>either edit bone envelopes, and parent your meshes to
armatures with vertex groups; the vertex weights will be constructed
using the bone envelopes</li>

      <li>or, simply parent meshes to bones (armature must be
in
pose mode)</li>

      <li>insert pose mode keys in different frames (press I to
insert key, and select Rot, Loc, or LocRot) to compose your animation</li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>create UV coordinates (be sure to check the blender
manual
for more details)
    <ul>

      <li>create seams (3D View, Edit Mode, select seam
vertices,
CTRL-E) </li>

      <li>in the 3D View, UV Face Select Mode, select all
faces,
press U-&gt;LSCM </li>

      <li>(optional) if you want to create your own texture: in
the UV/Image Editor, UVs-&gt;Save UV Face Layout, and process the
saved texture with your favorite 2D paint program </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>add materials to your meshes, and add one texture to each
material, with the following settings:
    <ul>

      <li>texture map input: UV </li>

      <li>texture map output: COL for diffuse map (base
texture) </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>for each texture:
    <ul>

      <li>set texture type to 'Image' </li>

      <li>either load a texture from 'C:\MORROWIND\textures',
or
put your custom texture in the 'C:\Program Files\Morrowind\Data
Files\Textures' folder, and load it from there. Note that Blender does
not read .dds files.</li>

      <li>although this is not recommended, textures can be
embedded by toggling the "packed" button next to the "Reload" button in
the Image tab</li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>(optional) animate meshes and/or empty objects (press I
to
insert key, and select Rot, Loc, or LocRot; for now, only location and
rotation channels are exported); define the animation groups in a text
buffer called 'Anim' (check source code for an example; so far we only
support Morrowind-type animations) </li>

  <li>(optional) to export vertex colors, turn on the
VCOL_PAINT
flag in the material tab </li>

  <li>(optional) Hull your model in a simple so-called
collision
mesh, which defines where the player cannot walk through (most of
Morrowind's static models have a collision mesh, you can see them in
the TES CS pressing F4 in the render window). You may want to create it
to speed up collision detection, to help the player walk over objects
such as stairs, or to allow the player to walk through certain parts of
your model such as spider webs.
    <ul>

      <li>create a mesh called
'RootCollisionNode' (object name, not datablock name)</li>

      <li>don't apply any
material to it </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>(optional) if you suspect that some of the faces of your
meshes are not convex, then you should let blender triangulate these
meshes (press CTRL-T in edit mode with all vertices selected), because
in that case, Blender's triangulation algorithm is less error prone
than the triangulation algorithm used in this script. </li>

  <li><strong>select the models that you wish to export</strong>,
and run this
script from the 'File-&gt;Export' menu. Note that the script looks
for unparented parents of the selected objects, and exports these root
objects along with all of their children, so you don't have to select
the whole model. </li>

</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Particle effects, cameras, and lights are not exported. We are working on it.</li>

  <li>Actions (for animation groups) are ignored. Workaround:
define actions in text buffer called "Anim".</li>

</ul>

<h3>Known Issues </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Ambient and emit colors are obtained by multiplication
with
the diffuse color.</li>

  <li>Blender double sided faces will be one sided in the NIF
file (workaround: duplicate faces).</li>

  <li>Export of directly animated&nbsp;meshes is buggy
unless
you parent without parent inverse
(CTRL-SHIFT-P). Workaround: don't animate meshes directly; instead,
parent meshes to bones and animate the bones.</li>

  <li>Non-uniformly scaled objects cannot be exported.
Workaround: apply size and rotation (CTRL-A). Unfortunately, this
workaround
does not work on empties. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Importer Notes</h2>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Launch the script, select the .NIF file you wish to
import,
and you are
set.</li>

  <li>Actually, no, that's not it if you also want to load the
textures.
Blender does not support the loading of .DDS textures, so in order to
load these you must provide an alternative file with the same filename,
but with the extension .TGA, .PNG, .BMP or .JPG. Also, selecting a base
folder for the textures has proved to be an impossible task, so the
script looks for them in the same folder as the .NIF file, or in
"..\Textures\[subdir\]*.*" if the NIF file resides in
"..\Meshes\[subdir\]*.*". This means that if your NIF file is, say,
"C:\Morrowind\Data
Files\Meshes\deadparrot.nif" and the texture is "C:\Morrowind\Data
Files\Textures\parrot\dead.dds" you should convert the texture and move
it to "C:\Morrowind\Data Files\Meshes\Textures\parrot\dead.tga". This
is also in order to keep the texture file path consistent for the time
we'll be able to export the modified meshes from Blender.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Limitations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The script doesn't import animation, particle
effects, multiple
UV channels.... the list is too long. We are working on it.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Old History </h3>

<p> (For recent history see the ChangeLog file) </p>

<ul>

  <li>1.5a: fixed a bug where texture files with trailing null
characters would
crash the importer</li>

  <li>1.6a: changed the material handling, now doesn't generate
duplicate materials, changed the mesh creation method. Now it builds
hierarchical relations
generating empties as correspondences to NiNodes</li>

  <li>1.7a: got rid of a couple of matrix operations, now I
apply
the transforms to
the mesh container rather than to the vertices, so there is no data
loss. The root node is scaled down to 1/10th of the original size and
rotated
-90# along the Z axis, but this is the only change introduced by the
importer. Now not only all the hierarchies are stored, but the empties
that act
as grouping widgets are moved to the correct relative coordinates, so
we might start to think about animations.</li>

  <li>1.8a: I did some little optimization, fixed a few things.
Now the root node is no longer rotated along the Z axis, as I realized
that I completely forgot that I should apply his transform matrix to
the root node as well. It is only scaled down to 10% of the original
size, and as all his
children inherit this transformation the meshes are much easier to
handle. I have also added a much better support for textures and
materials,
that are now only parsed once and reused if identical (obtained from
the same node). I couldn't notice any speed improvement, because on my
machine the
import is pretty much istantaneous anyway, but I believe that this
wastes less memory.</li>

  <li>1.9a: Not published, it didn't really introduce much
change
to what was
already there.</li>

  <li>2.0a: Big things afoot, now I got bones! The script now
will load single or
multiple armatures, and build each armature's bone tree in the rest
position. The bone head position is correct, the tail is approximated
and the rotation is botched. The trouble is that Blender's bone API is
a little bit messy. Let's say very messy. The NIF bones store their
orientation and origin as a matrix relative
to the parent node, while in Blender all coordinates are relative to
the armature node. And on top of that while I have a getRestMatrix
method I don't have an equivalent setRestMatrix one. I am still working
on this, but I already have a couple of ideas on
what I can to to get these damn thing working properly. I still don't
have the skinning info, so moving the bones about won't
change the pose of the model. But if you want to help me out have a
look at the NiSkinInstance and NiSkinData nodes, NiSkinData in
particular. NiSkinInstance holds a list of bones that influence the
mesh, the class is already defined in the script, even though it isn't
used. In the smaller updates, if the script can't find a full Python
installation it will print a customized error showing the Python
version Blender was compiled with. This is not necessarily the Python
version you need, but is sure to work. At this time the correct version
is Python 2.3.5</li>

  <li>1.0.1: I took the occasion of a new Blender version out
and
changed my
versioning convention. Sorry about the confusion. Fixed a bug that
would hang the script on Blender 2.37. Now bones are 'a' proper length
(NIF bone systems don't report a bone
length), and are aligned properly, well, within 1 degree of their roll
position</li>

  <li>1.0.2: A few (quite a few actually) bugfixes by Amorilia
(whoopee, another
python coder onboard!). Now the script won't crash with larger NIFs.
And read the right number
of blocks. And won't overwrite existing meshes etc.. </li>

  <li>1.0.3: Added a new way to roll bones to their proper
position, might save a
few cycles, tho sometimes it still needs to approximate the result.
Changed the way the nif format is detected. The script now also detects
the file version and can test against a list of different file
versions. It also allows for longer headers, like in the case of "Zoo
Thycoon 2"
NIF files. Zoo Thycoon 2 files are way too different from Morrowind's
files to be
imported, though.</li>

  <li>1.0.4: Removed a bunch of debug messages to speed up
things
a little. Added vertex groups to the imported info, but the skinning
doesn't work
yet. To work properly both the meshes and the armature should share the
same coordinates system apparently, and the nested transformations that
are applied to both are making it very difficult to come up with a
working system. I really ran out of ideas, I am afraid. Meshes now are
imported as an "object" wrapped by a NiNode, and
therefore the outliner tree is a little simpler. This also loses a
little transform info, but nothing you will notice on the screen anyway
as the transform matrix of the NiNode and NiTriShape are combined while
importing.</li>

  <li>1.0.5: Fixed a few typos and a couple of mistakes that
Amorilia pointed out.
Still incomplete, by far, but seems to be approaching the "usable"
state.</li>

  <li>1.0.6: Added Amorilia's corrections to the import of UV
seams. Changed the
name of the file to reflect the fact that the importer is version
specific. As of this version the licensing is under a BSD license, to
avoid
confusion when distributing together with Amorilia's export script.
However, copyright on the two script is still with the respective
authors. Also, all previous versions of this script are still to be
considered
as governed by the GPL license. I also removed a small portion of the
readme regarding python setup, as
it was confusing, redundant and most likely just wrong. For the moment
I'll rely on the Blender's user forums, until I can come up with a
decent tutorial on setting up python properly.</li>
