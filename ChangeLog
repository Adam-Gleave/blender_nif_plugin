Version 2.4.4 (***)
* import option to disable combining of shapes into multimaterial meshes 
(suggested by Malo, and contributed by Alphax)
* importing a nif with an unsupported root block now only gives error message
instead of raising an exception (reported by TheDaywalker)
* fixed fallout 3 import of packed shapes (such as mopps)

Version 2.4.3 (7 Mar 2009)

by figurework)

Version 2.4.2 (15 Feb 2009)

without a name) will have no name in the nif; this fixes some issues with
Fallout 3 (reported by malo)
* import fix for names that end with null character (reported by alphax)
* if not all faces have a body part, they will be selected on export to make
it easier to identify them; error message has been improved too (reported by
malo)

messages (reported by malo)

Version 2.4.1 (2 Feb 2009)
* Fallout 3 BSShaderXXX blocks are no longer shared to avoid issues with the
engine
* NiSourceTexture improvements:
  - pixel layout exports as "6" (DEFAULT) for versions 10.0.1.0 and higher
  - use mipmaps exports as "1" (YES)

  exported into the extra shader slots instead of in the regular slots
* minor cleanups in the code

Version 2.4.0 (25 Jan 2009)
* switched to using the standard logging module for log messages
* improvements for multi-material mopp import and export (but not entirely
functional yet)
* improved self-validating bind position algorithm
  - geometries are transformed first to a common bind pose (if it exists, a
  warning is issued if no common bind pose is found) - some misaligned
  geometry pieces will now be aligned correctly with the armature, this is
  most noticable with Morrowind imports
  - bone nodes are transformed to bind position in two phases, to reduce
  rounding errors - some bones that were not sent to the bind pose with the
  older algorithm will now be correct

* quick bug fix if you had multiple materials in your mopp

Version 2.3.4 (24 Jul 2008)
* fix for megami tensei imagine collision import

Version 2.1.15 (Oct 19, 2007)
* pycheck: added pychecker script (see http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/)
* test: added test script to automatically run importer and exporter on a range
of selected nif and blend files

* Import: removed duplicate calculation of armature inverse matrix
* Import: replaced the deprecated method of linking armature to the scene
* Export: improved flatten skin so it works better in some cases

Version 2.1.14 (Oct 14, 2007)
* Import: fixed a transform bug which was introduced in 2.1.13, skinned
geometries had their transform applied twice, so this fixes import of those
skinned models that do not have a unit transform.
* Export: fixed a typo
* Import/Export/Config/GUI: restructured the scripts, in particular the
import script has been transformed into an OOP class, so it requires
no more globals for various settings. All gui and config related
things have moved to a new nif_common.py library, as well as some
common settings such as checking for Blender and PyFFI version. The
result is that the code has been substantially simplified. The import
and export script now also use exactly the same system to run the
config gui.

Version 2.1.13 (Oct 13, 2007)

old style (RootCollisionNode named mesh) morrowind collision export

Version 2.1.11 (Oct 3, 2007)
* Export: complain on unweighted vertices and select them, instead of adding an
extra bone (this is a better alternative to the Scene Root.00 "feature" which
was pretty frustrating at times when you had to hunt down unweighted vertices)
* Export: switched to using Mesh instead of using the deprecated NMesh
* Export: fixed frame time bug
* Import: removing dummy index does not properly delete the vertex from
the mesh (yielding errors in the vertex key data), so reverted back to shift
checking algorithm to fix face index order; the vertex order is shifted in
place yielding simpler code and faster performance
* Import: removed _bindMatrix zombies, other minor cleanups
* Config: check blender version and raise exception if blender is outdated

Version 2.1.10 (Sep 27, 2007)
* Export: fairly large restructuring of the code, the Python modules are only
loaded once
* Export: fixed alpha controller export
* Export: removed disfunctional material color controller export
* Export: added a timer
* Export: new option to merge seams between objects, if you separated meshes
in different parts then on export often seams could appear between the parts
(the better bodies meshes are good examples of this problem), now there is an
option to recalculate the normals on seams between objects on export (for
better bodies the result is a seamless body on re-export)

Version 2.1.9 (Sep 21, 2007)
* Export: new option to force dds extension of texture paths
* updated hull script for quickly creating bounding spheres

* Export: raise exception if bone names are not unique
* Export: fixed exception when bone name or armature name was very long
* Import/Export: support for Morrowind collision shapes using a polyheder
bounds shape

Version 2.1.6 (Sep 5, 2007)

* Export: fixed more bugs in bhkConvexVerticesShape
* Export: NiVertexColorProperty and NiZBufferProperty blocks for CivIV

Version 2.1.3 (Aug 19, 2007)
* Installer: also check in HKCU for registry keys of Python and PyFFI (fixes
rare installation issue, see bug #1775859 on the SF tracker)
* new script for reducing number of influences per vertex, running this script
before export helps if the skin partitioning algorithm complains about losing
weights

Version 2.1.2 (Aug 17, 2007)
* Installer: make sure user is admin ("fixes" the Vista bug)
* Import: parent selected objects to armature when importing skeleton only

Version 2.1 (Aug 12, 2007)
* Export: added support for Oblivion collisions
  - bhkBoxShape (from Blender 'Box' bounding shape)
  - bhkSphereShape (from Blender 'Sphere' bounding shape)
  - bhkCapsuleShape (from Blender 'Cylinder' bounding shape)
  - bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape (from Blender 'Static TriangleMesh' bounding shape)
  - bhkConvexVerticesShape (from Blender 'Convex Hull Polytope' bounding shape)
  Note that many of the settings are not well understood, so you probably still
  have to tweak the collision settings in nifskope. But at least the collision
  geometries should be properly exported.
