* Import: Added support for texturing in the editor 3D view. Now the textures will show up in textured mode if loaded.
* Import: NiMorph Controllers that m4444x coded. Haven't tested it, but it doesn't break the previous functionality, so it should be fine

* Export: Vertex export method improved, extreme speedup!
* Import/Export: Transparency support improved.
* Import: Small fix in the import of vertex colors.

* Initial bundled release of the importer v1.0.6 and exporter v0.8 on SourceForge.
