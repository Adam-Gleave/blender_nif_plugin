Version 1.0 (Oct 12, 2005):
* Initial bundled release of the importer v1.0.6 and exporter v0.8 on SourceForge.

Version 1.1 (Oct 31, 2005):
* Export: Fixed bug pointed out by Sabregirl, on mesh_mat_shininess.
* Export: Applied m4444x's patches to exporter (texture flipping), changed names, included exporter readme file.
* Import/Export: Changed the licensing to BSD.
* Import: Added support for texturing in the editor 3D view. Now the textures will show up in textured mode if loaded.
* Import: NiMorph Controllers that m4444x coded. Haven't tested it, but it doesn't break the previous functionality, so it should be fine
* Export: Added an option for stripping the texture's file path
* Export: Support for subsurfed meshes (display level).
* Export: Vertex export method improved, extreme speedup!
* Import/Export: Transparency support improved.
* Import: Small fix in the import of vertex colors.
* Import: Autodetect Morrowind style texture path; if you load a NIF from ...\meshes\... then the importer will look in ...\textures\* for the NIF textures.
* Export: Fixed animation group export.
* Import: Multiple texture folders.
* Import/Export: number of vertices and number of faces is unsigned short: fix in importer, and added range check in exporter.
* Import/Export: Added glow mapping.
* Export: Fixed texture flipping
* Import/Export: Config file support.
* Import/Export: Now we have a GUI for setting various options.
* Import: Solved problem with textures embedded in NIF file; textures will not load but the script will still load the meshes.

Version 1.2 (Dec 23, 2005):
* Import/Export: updated for Blender 2.40
* Export: now uses Niflib, which implies that it runs much faster, the code is much cleaner, and multiple NIF version support is in the making
* Export: replaced old crappy config file system with Blender's native Script Config Editor system
* Export: new feature - texture flipping
* Export: new feature - export of bones, armatures, and vertex weights (finally!!!)
* Export: packed texture feature has been temporarily dropped; this functionality is being transferred to Niflib

Version 1.3 (Jan 21, 2006):
* Import/Export: Vertex key animation support (geometry morphing).
* Export: Bugfix in bone animation export (transformations sometimes wouldn't show up correctly before).
* Import: Improved bone length calculation.
* Export: Added NIF v10.0.1.0 support.
* Export: Skinning bugfix for multimaterialed meshes.
* Export: Vertex weight calculation optimized, and no more annoying console messages!
* Export: Embedded textures reestablished.

Version 1.4 (Feb 12, 2006)
* Import: completely rewritten, uses Niflib now just like exporter
* Import/Export: support for all NIF versions up to 20.0.0.4!!
* Import/Export: corrected specularity import/export (thanks NeOmega)
* Import/Export: hidden flag via object wire drawtype
* Import: full skinning support (but still no animation)
* Import: better bone length estimation, automatic alignment
