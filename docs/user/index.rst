User Documentation
==================

.. warning::

   User documentation is incomplete.

.. todo::

   We need to split this into different documents:

   * installation (more or less done, see below),
   * basic tutorial,
   * list of all features
     (it would be a good habit to document every feature we have!)
     and quick instructions for how to use each of them.
   * license,
   * changelog,
   * anything else?
