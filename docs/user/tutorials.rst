Tutorials
=========

The
`quick-start guide <http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/Blender/Quick_Start>`_
describes how to prepare your textures and how you can use the scripts.
The guide also lists the limitations of the scripts, known issues, and workarounds for some issues.

   Port the quick start guide to the documentation, and give a pointer
   to the generated Sphinx docs.
